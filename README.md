# Hemlock demo

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dsbowen/hemlock-demo/HEAD/?urlpath=lab)

Hemlock is an open-research python package for creating surveys and behavioral experiments. It aspires to be the most powerful and flexible way to create online studies, with broad applications in marketing and behavioral science research.

This binder gives you a small taste of what Hemlock is capable of.

1. Run a notebook (start with `START_HERE.ipynb`). This creates previews of Hemlock pages in a `tmp` folder.
2. Go to the `tmp` folder and open `preview.html` (and `preview (1).html`, etc.).
